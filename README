The generic nucleo board documentation says

User LD2: the green LED is a user LED connected to Arduino signal D13
corresponding to MCU I/O PA5 (pin 21) or PB13 (pin 34) depending on
the STM32 target. Please refer to Table 10 to Table 17.

And looking at those tables for the F401RE board D13 is PA5 on this
board.  So that is the gpio pin to target.

First we have to enable the peripheral (enable clocks, power it up if
you will).

Then setup the gpio for push pull out.

Then toggle the gpio pin on and off.

Once built take one of the .bin files and copy it to the mounted
NUCLEO drive, preferrably using the same name as a destination every
time (flash.bin for example).  It appears that it loads and resets
the target mcu right away rather than having to press a reset button
like the old days with the original mbed.

To verify that it is you blinking the led and not some stale software
change the last loop to 800000 instead of 200000 and see the off
time is longer than the on time, then put it back and see that the
on and off times are again the same.
